# Tic Tac Toe

My goal was to get familiar with factory and module patterns.

I found the way in which the module pattern keeps the global namespace clean by intentionally exposing only the required properties (via the return statement) to be neat.

I'm not sure whether the module pattern is preferrable over using classes. I'm not an expert on either of the two, but for a newcomer classes are more explicit with their intent and reads easier to me.
